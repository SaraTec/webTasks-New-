# Installation and launch of the website

1. Clone the repository
  "git clone https://github.com/RostyslavSynenko/Lv-469.NodeJS.git"
2. Go to the webtasks folder
3. Open console and install all necessary dependencies for the server with "npm install" (or "npm i") command
4. Run the server with the "npm run server" command
5. Go to the client folder and open the index.html (or any other file with an .html extension).

P.S.: Maybe later I will also run the client side on the server. :)
